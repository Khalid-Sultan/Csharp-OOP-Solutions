Terminology
O(n^3) is equivalent to the page*row*column. It is a general representation of their product.
Question 1-A
	Time - O(n^3) because the algorithm needs to iterate over every single item in the page,row,column consecutively
	Space - O(n^3) because we stored a 3d jagged array
Question 1-B
	Time - O(n^3) because the algorithm needs to iterate over every single item in the page,row,column consecutively
	Space - O(n^3) because we stored a 3d jagged array
Question 1-C
	Time - O(n^3) because the algorithm needs to iterate over every single item in the page,row,column consecutively
	Space - O(n^3) because we stored a 3d jagged array
Question 2
	Time - O(n^3) because the algorithm needs to iterate over every single item in the page,row,column consecutively
	Space - O(n^3) because we stored a 3d multidimensional array
